# The Rice Calculator

I bought a rice cooker recently (nice!) and now I'm trying out a lot of - healthy - dishes that include rice in all shapes and colours. But it's slightly inconvenient (aka it sucks) when I cook rice for the whole day and then have to guess how much cooked rice I have to take out for one portion.

The point is: nobody can tell me how much uncooked rice I need in order to get "200 grammes of cooked rice", like some recipes propose, because every type of rice is different and there is no rule of thumb for all.

## As I need to gather a lot of data, this project might take a while.

**You can participate with your cooking skills. :)**

If you have a decent rice cooker, you can simply use the reference amount of 100 grammes of rice, cook it, weigh it and drop me a message with the cooked weight, the amount of water and the time it took to make the perfect rice.
